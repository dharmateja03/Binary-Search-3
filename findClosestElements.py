# TimeComplexity:O(k+logN)
# Space:Constant
# Appraoch:
# BruteForce:Have distances array , pair with elements in arr and sort get first k elements
# TwoPointer:Have two pointer compress unitll len is equal to k 
#         abs1=abs(nums[l]-x)
#         abs2=abs(nums[h]-x)
# Sorted Always think of binary Search and 2 pointers
# BinarySearch:
#   instead of finding x lets find satrting of our ans with size k 
#   we compute mid this is starting point of our ans and mid+k(why not mid+k-1?)
#   arr[mid + k - 1] is the last element in the current window. we're not comparing elements inside the current window. weâ€™re comparing edges of two neighboring windows:
#   Current window: arr[mid : mid + k]
#   Next window: arr[mid + 1 : mid + k + 1]

# So to decide whether to shift right, you look outside your current window at arr[mid + k]
#   we compare distances of both 
#            disL=x-arr[mid]
#            disH=arr[mid+k]-x
# based on that decison we move our low or high pointer
