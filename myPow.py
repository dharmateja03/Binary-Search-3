#Time and Space Compelxity 
  # Recursion: O(Logn),O(LogN)
  # While loop: O(Logn),O(1)
#Approach: in recurion we cut n by 2 always if its even and multiply with each other if nis odd , we just multiply x and n-=1
# In loop based we change val x(muliply by itself) if its even , else we update result 
#In Python we should always reduce val of n If n is negative and you donâ€™t flip it, the loop decreases n endlessly or goes into a cycle.
# Python integers can go negative infinitely â€” there's no lower limit like in C.


#Recursion, After each recursion cut n by 2
